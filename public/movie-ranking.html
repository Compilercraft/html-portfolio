    <h1>THE BEST MOVIE ACCORDING TO BHAVISHAY</h1>
    <h2>My top-3 Movies of ALL Time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
    <p>
      From the wise guys of Goodfellas to The Sopranos, all crime dynasties that
      came after The Godfather are descendants of the Corleones
    </p>
    <h3>Citizin kane (1941)</h3>
    <p>
      Back in the headlines thanks to David Fincher brilliantly acerbic
      making-of drama Mank, Citizen Kane always finds a way to renew itself for
      a new generation of film lovers
    </p>
    <h3>In the mood for love (2000)</h3>
    <p>
      Can a film really be an instant classic? Anyone who watched In The Mood
      for Love when it was released in 2000 may have said yes.
